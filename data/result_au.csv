1,Customs duty rates for tobacco and tobacco products - September 2022Press ,담배 및 담배 제품에 대한 관세율 - 2022년 9월 보도,2022년 8월 23일 게시,"Australian Customs Notice No. 2022/37 Customs duty rates for tobacco and tobacco products – September 2022 This notice sets out the arrangements for the excise-equivalent customs duty rates on tobacco and tobacco products, as a result of the Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings (AWOTE) number released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 18 August 2022. Provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provide for customs duty rates on tobacco products, where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis, to be indexed to the AWOTE by application of an indexation factor. The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent AWOTE figure by the highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the 2012 December Quarter. When the indexation factor is greater than one, the new customs duty rates are determined by the application of the indexation factor. When the indexation factor is less than or equal to one, no change to the customs duty rates are made. The figures used to calculate the AWOTE indexation factor for September 2022 are set out in the table below. Most recent AWOTE Highest previous June or December Quarter AWOTE June Quarter 2022 December Quarter 2021 AWOTE Indexation factor Weight conversion factor for September 2020 onwards 1769.80 1748.40 1.012 0.0007 As the indexation factor for September 2022 (1.012) is greater than one, and where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis, customs duty rates for tobacco products in Schedules 3 and 4A to 14 to the Customs Tariff Act will be increased by application of the indexation factor. Provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs duty rates applied to tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ or a ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by the applicable weight conversion factor. From 1 September 2020, the new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by the weight conversion factor, 0.0007. Australia’s customs service The rates of excise-equivalent customs duty for tobacco and tobacco products that apply from 1 September 2022 are set out below.

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. The December 2021 Quarter CPI figure (121.3) will be used to determine the indexation factor for the duty rate increase applied on 1 August 2022, as it is higher than the previously used June 2021 Quarter CPI figure (refer to ACN 2022/05). On 27 July 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2022 Quarter CPI figure (126.1). The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2022 are set out in the table below: Most recent CPI number Highest previous June or December Quarter June Quarter 2022 December Quarter 2021 Indexation Factor 126.1 121.3 1.040 As the indexation factor for August 2022 (1.040) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff, will increase by the application of this factor. The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 August 2022, are set out in Table 1 below and supersede the rates outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2022/05. The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  Schedule 4A (Singaporean originating goods)  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods)  Schedule 6A (Peruvian originating goods)  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods) Australia’s customs service  Schedule 8 (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand originating goods)  Schedule 8A (Pacific Island originating goods)  Schedule 8B (Trans-Pacific Partnership originating goods)  Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods)  Schedule 9A (Indonesian originating goods)  Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods)  Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods)  Schedule 12 (Chinese originating goods)  Schedule 13 (Hong Kong originating goods), and  Schedule 14 (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership originating goods) in the Customs Tariff Act.
